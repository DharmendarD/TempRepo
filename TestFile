Title: Implement Login Page (UI + Validation + Auth)

Description:
As a user,
 I want to securely log in to the application using my email/username and password,
 So that I can access my personalized dashboard and features.
This ticket covers the implementation of the login page UI, input validation, error handling, authentication integration, and accessibility support. It includes basic functionality such as field validation, password masking, login errors, and redirect upon success.

Scope:
Email/Username and Password input fields


Client-side validation


Password masking with toggle


"Forgot password" link


"Remember me" checkbox (if required)


API integration for login


Error messaging for invalid inputs or credentials


Redirect on successful login



Acceptance Criteria:
Login Form Display


Login form includes:


Email/Username input


Password input


Login button


"Forgot password?" link


(Optional) "Remember Me" checkbox


Input Validation


Invalid email formats are rejected with a relevant error message.


Both fields are required; show validation errors if left empty.


Empty Field Handling


Given a user submits the login form with one or more empty fields,Then the user should see an error message indicating the required fields.


Successful Login


Valid credentials log the user in and redirect to the dashboard/home page.


Unsuccessful Login


Invalid credentials show a clear error message (e.g., "Invalid username or password").


Password Visibility Toggle


A "show/hide" icon allows the user to toggle password visibility.


Forgot Password Link


Clicking "Forgot password?" redirects to the password recovery page.


Remember Me Option


If checked, the session persists after closing the browser.


If unchecked, the session expires on browser close or after timeout.


Security Requirements


Form must use HTTPS.


Password is masked by default.


Inputs should be protected against common attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).


Accessibility


All form fields are keyboard accessible.


Fields include ARIA labels or screen-reader support.
